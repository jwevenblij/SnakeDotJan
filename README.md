A simple Snake game fully coded in Java. Uses the Swing + FlatLaf library and Graphics2D.

 Game logic:
- The snake's movement speed increases for every 10 food eaten.
- Food can never spawn in the same location as any of the snake's bodyparts.
- The game over screen is shown with the total final snake length when the snake either collides with a wall or itself.
- The snake cannot mirror its own active movement direction (go left when moving right, up when going down, etc.)

 Controls:
- W : UP
- A : LEFT
- S : DOWN
- D : RIGHT
- SPACEBAR (on gameover) : Restart Game
